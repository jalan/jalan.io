# jalan.io

This is my personal website, built with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)
and currently deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Development

Run `hugo server -D` and go to http://localhost:1313/ to see the site as you
work. 

## Deployment

Any commit to master should trigger an automatic deployment. Deploy logs are
[publicly available](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jalan/deploys).
